# 💫 About Me:

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Tu** — a passionate backend developer on a mission to master the art of building robust, scalable systems. 

> **My Philosophy:** `Learn. Code. Eat. Sleep. Repeat.` (The order might change depending on the severity of the bug! 😄)

Currently navigating the exciting journey of software development, I'm deeply fascinated by the **invisible magic** that happens behind the scenes: 
* 🛰️ **Databases** communicating across servers.
* 🏗️ **APIs** orchestrating seamless data flows.
* 💎 **Elegant Architectures** that stand the test of time.

## 🎯 My 25-Year Vision: 
Transform from a curious learner into a **Seasoned Backend Architect** who doesn't just write code, but crafts digital experiences that matter.

When I'm not debugging or optimizing database queries, you'll find me:
- 🌐 Exploring emerging technologies.
- 🐧 Contributing to Open Source.
- 🖋️ Overthinking the "perfect" commit message (it's a lifestyle).

**Fun Fact:** I believe the best solutions are brewed from a perfect balance of caffeine, insatiable curiosity, and a solid 8 hours of sleep. ☕✨
